MoCap
===

A general purpose motion capture data parser. This project intends to provide tools to work with motion caputre data. This module will allow programers to easily convert motion caputre data into a Haskell datatype representation. In the future tools to generate motion caputre data will be provided. 

## Features

MoCap is in early development. Currently only amc skeleton files can be parsed and only the root and bonedata section are supported.
